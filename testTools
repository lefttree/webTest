JSTestDriver requires js test files, requires tests to be executed with their test framework

YUI Test, want to use our existing tests
Yeti works with unmodified YUI Test_based tests
Unit tests or Functional tests are all fine.

Yeti is a test launcher, it only launches tests and reports results.


Selenium is complicated and doesn't work with mobile devices.
